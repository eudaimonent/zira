========================================================================
Zira is a fork of SimianGrid [ http://code.google.com/p/openmetaverse/ ]
to provide a SimianGrid API interface to an OpenSimulator ROBUST
backend.  This will allow, for example, use of the SimianGrid web
frontend with a stock OpenSim ROBUST backend.

ZIRA IS NOT A USER WEB INTERFACE.  Zira does, however, allow you to
run the SimianGrid web frontend for users with ROBUST-powered backend
services.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an illustration, say you are running the SimianGrid web frontend,
and it tried to fetch the email address of a registered grid user by
POST-ing the following request:

    RequestMethod=GetUser&UserID=6dce435b-b22b-4b71-ba25-ad298c97594b

If that request was sent that to a ROBUST-powered UserAccountService,
it would have no idea what you're talking about.  Instead, Zira will
take that request, find the appropriate info in the database, and
respond in a way that SimianGrid API-speaking components expect, e.g.:

    {
        "Success":true,
        "User":
        {
            "UserID":"6dce435b-b22b-4b71-ba25-ad298c97594b",
            "Name":"John Doe",
            "Email":"john.doe@email.com",
        }
    }
